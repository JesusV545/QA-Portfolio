# 🚀 QA Learning Journey

### From EMT to Software Tester — a curious path toward quality and reliability in tech.

Welcome! This repository documents my personal journey into the world of **Quality Assurance (QA)** and **Software Testing**.  
After several years working as an **Emergency Medical Technician (EMT)** — a role built on precision, teamwork, and critical thinking — I found myself drawn to a similar mindset in software development: **preventing failure before it happens**.

This space serves as a living record of my transition into tech — combining my curiosity, analytical habits, and desire to build reliable systems that work when they matter most.

## 🧭 Purpose

This repository is my structured learning journal for becoming a **QA Engineer / Software Tester**, covering:
- Fundamentals of **manual testing**  
- Exploration of **API and automation testing**  
- Real-world projects, bug reports, and test plans  
- Continuous learning in **DevOps, cloud testing, and CI/CD integration**

Each section reflects not just tutorials or notes — but *hands-on experiments* and reflections from my own growth process.

## 🧩 Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `/manual-tests` | Test cases, defect reports, and exploratory testing exercises |
| `/api-tests` | Postman collections, API test results, and documentation |
| `/automation-demo` | Selenium/Playwright automation scripts and experiments |
| `/notes` | Study materials, testing strategies, and insights gathered along the way |

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Develop a solid foundation in **manual and automated testing**  
- Build practical experience with tools like **Jira, Postman, Selenium, and GitHub Actions**  
- Strengthen understanding of the **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)**  
- Transition into a professional **QA or Software Developer in Test (SDET)** role

## 💬 Reflections

What drew me to software testing isn’t just technology — it’s the **mindset of precision and prevention**.  
As an EMT, I learned that small mistakes can have big consequences.  
In QA, the same is true — a single overlooked bug can ripple through an entire system.  
That connection fuels my motivation to build and test software that’s **dependable, secure, and human-centered**.

## 🧰 Tech Stack (In Progress)
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript  
- **Tools:** Jira, Postman, Selenium, GitHub Actions, Jenkins  
- **Frameworks:** PyTest, Playwright, Cypress (coming soon)  
- **Concepts:** SDLC, STLC, Agile Testing, CI/CD, API Testing  

---

## 🌱 Next Steps
- [ ] Complete Postman API certification  
- [ ] Automate a full web workflow using Selenium or Playwright  
- [ ] Create a full QA test plan and documentation for a sample project  
- [ ] Contribute to open-source testing or documentation efforts
